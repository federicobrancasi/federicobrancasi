# 👋 Hey, I'm Federico - Let's Code the Future Together!

Greetings from my coding corner! I'm Federico, an enthusiastic explorer in the expansive realm of computer science. Currently, I'm conducting ML research at CERN on model optimization techniques, after completing my Master's thesis research at ETH Zurich on AI model quantization. I'm on the lookout for like-minded visionaries eager to shape the future alongside me.
